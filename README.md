- Over time both marks consumtpion changed unequally, but in 2017 Volvo surpassed BMW and now Volvo had lower fuel consumption.
-  What is interesting to notice that Volvo from 8.5 L/100 in 2009 decreased their fuel consumption to ~ 6.7L/100, but BMW did not realy changed their average consumption, they had about 7.5 in 2009 and has about the same numbers in 2022.
